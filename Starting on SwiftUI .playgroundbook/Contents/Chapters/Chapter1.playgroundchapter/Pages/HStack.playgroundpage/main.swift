 # HStack

Knowing the concept of VStack, it is extremely intuitive to understand what HStack is, since while VStack is a Vertical Stack, HStack is an Horizontal Stack.

So in our analogy it would be to place our bricks next to each other in the construction of our wall. In the case of SwiftUI it means placing one View next to the other in the construction of our screens.

Makes sense, right? ðŸ˜„

Look at the image bellow:

![HStack](myImages/HStack.png)
 
 The code:
    
    HStack {
        Brick() // ðŸ§± leftmost
        Brick()
        Brick()
        Brick()
        Brick() // ðŸ§± rightmost
    }
