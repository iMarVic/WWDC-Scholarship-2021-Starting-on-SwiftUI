 # üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Let's Practice
 
 ## It's time to code ü§ì

 Now that I've introduced you to some SwiftUI concepts (our Stacks) we can try to do something cool using them, like creating a digital contact card to put our contacts like social networks, phones and emails, all in one place, to make it easier for people to get in touch with us.

 I already made one for myself, see how it turned out:

 ![Card](myImages/Card.png)

 And now I‚Äôd like you to make one for yourself too, and notice the Stacks and Views I used to build my card.

 To make things a little easier, I already left the code almost ready for you to change it with the items you want to put on your card.

 There may be some things that you may not know yet, but I left some comments in the code to help you.

 # üí• Now it's your turn!

I hope this book on SwiftUI Stacks has helped you üòä
 
Finally I strongly recommend you try to take this tutorial that uses the concepts we saw here: [Creating and Combining Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views)
