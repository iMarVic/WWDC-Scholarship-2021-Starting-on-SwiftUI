 # Starting on SwiftUI
 
 ## Welcome ðŸ˜„
 
 Hello! Iâ€™m Igor Vicente and Iâ€™m also learning SwiftUI. I started studying it last month (March, 2021) at the Apple Developer Academy in Porto Alegre, Brazil. And I've learned a lot!

 I believe we can all teach a lot of things all the time, so even though I am a beginner I would like to introduce you to a little of what I have learned so far, because when we share knowledge we also learn a lot! I hope you enjoy!

 In this Playground Book I will introduce you to some fundamental concepts to start developing an application in SwiftUI. You will see the concepts of VStack, Hstack and ZStack. I will explain to you one by one in the next pages.

 And to reinforce what we learn we will build, together, a basic but very useful application using the concepts seen here, because it is by doing that we make mistakes and by making mistakes that we learn.

 Here we go!
